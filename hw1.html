<h2>HW 1

<p> One part of the chapter one reading that stood out to me was the second section titled Software Entropy. I felt like part of what was said in this section I could relate to in more everyday manner than just in coding. However I feel that because of that fact, it may one way or another have an effect on some code I will write. I see the broken windows theory with a few things that I do on a daily basis including homework, keeping my room clean, and getting simple tasks done. It is never my intention to continue "breaking windows," but that's just how it usually turns out.</p>

<p2>  I feel that what this section talked about could be a problem in the future because I tend to already have similar everyday tasks that end up this way. When it comes to keeping my room clean I tend to slowly let my room get dirty and become a little more lazy about it each day. Eventually that builds up and then my room is dirty. This is exactly what the broken windows theory says that after one broken window, more are likely to come. However once I decide that it is too dirty, then I take the time to go through and clean my room thoroughly and for the next few week or so maintain its cleanliness. But then the broken windows start to appear again. It is a process that continually repeats itself for me.</p2>

<p3>  The same idea applies to my homework, I just let all my homework build up until about the day before then do it all at once. I personally hate doing homework on separate occasions so I do everything at once. Occasionally this can be bad because of the amount I have been assigned or how long it takes me but I usually can estimate both those. But I will push off one assignment then another and another until one night I have to do all of them. In other words I have to fix all the broken windows. This doesn't always happen and lately I have been trying to not do this simply because it is a horrible habit.</p3>

<p4>  I have just listed two examples where I can be a prime example of the broken windows theory, however I am not saying that these happen all the time. Just two examples that I myself have noticed throughout my years at school and home. Both are things that can be worked upon as well. Also, this doesn't mean that I will struggle with this idea in the future, but it does propose a potential hazard in the future.</p4>
